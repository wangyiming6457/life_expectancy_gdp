# life_expectancy_gdp
Investigate if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.
The goals are to prepare data, followed by analysis with plots, and seek to explain the findings from the study.

Here are a few questions that this project will seek to answer:

Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
